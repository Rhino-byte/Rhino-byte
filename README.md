## 👋 Hi there, I'm Savins Nanyaemuny

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer and data analyst who loves diving into complex projects that bridge the gap between code and real-world insights. Here’s a bit about me and what I’m working on:

**🚀 About Me**

I'm an enthusiastic learner and developer interested in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Computer Vision. Whether it’s unraveling insights from aviation data, exploring the relationship between movie genres and performance metrics, or implementing trading strategies in cryptocurrency markets, I thrive on using data to make informed decisions and drive impactful results.

Businesses aim to personalize user experiences in a data-driven world to boost engagement, satisfaction, and revenue. For a movie streaming platform, a recommendation system can provide tailored suggestions based on user preferences and behavior. This project focuses on building a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and a hybrid model to enhance recommendation quality and precision, ultimately improving user experience and platform engagement.

## GARCH Model Analysis 

**[Cryptocurrency GARCH Strategy](https://github.com/Rhino-byte/Time-Series-)** notebook here 👇🏿
- Leveraging Kraken's API and implementing GARCH strategies to analyze and predict market trends.
